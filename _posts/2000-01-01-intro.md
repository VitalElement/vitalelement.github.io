# Free Unrestricted Toolchains
VitalElement maintain and provide several GCC and Clang based toolchains giving you the fastest install to execution time.

All the headache is taken out of configuring and setting up toolchains.

# Technical Preview
VitalElement Studio is currently in a Technical Preview stage, and is pre-release software. This means that you are likely to find
bugs and features that don't work properly or are unpolished. We will soon have forums and facilities for you to report 
issues and request features. The software will check for updates when it starts up and will be updated regularly.

Please follow the blog to find details on features as they are added.

# Coming Soon
VitalElement Studio is going cross platform. This is planned for Autumn 2015. We currently only support Windows, but hope to support 
Linux and Mac. If you are a developer and interested in helping please contact dan@walms.co.uk
