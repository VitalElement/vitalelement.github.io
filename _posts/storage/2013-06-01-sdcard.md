title: SD-Card Protocol

One of the early goals of BitThunder was to be able to replace U-Boot by loading a Linux
kernel from an SD-card. Unfortunately documentation and examples are a little, well sparse. So I've decided to write
a blog post which describes the protocol, and how the BitThunder sd-card subsystem works.

Note, this post discusses the SDIO protocol, not the SPI protocol.

# Initialising the Card.

In many small devices, like micro-controllers, the sd-card will be used directly from power-on
but in more complex system the sd-card could be in an undefined state left over from a
boot-loader or bootrom.

The following sequence will allow you to get the card into a reset known state.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Is the controller reset?</h5>
  <p>
	On the Xilinx Zynq platform, the SDIO controller is itself left in an undefined state after being used by the BootROM.
  	We found that using the SDHCI reset register left the peripheral in a pseudo-functional state, whereby some data transfers
	would always contain the data of the previous transfer. To solve this we asserted a peripheral reset signal using the
	processors system-level control registers. If you have problems, make sure your controller is completely reset.
	See <a href="https://github.com/jameswalmsley/bitthunder/commit/18a55f3963d473b212e7f9783918bc0cfa0349c9"> the commit for details</a>.

## Step 1. Send GO_IDLE_STATE (CMD0).

Send CMD0, it requires 0 arguments, and returns NO response. This command is only required
to be sent ONCE. (Some forums using SPI mention this should be repeated, but for SDIO its not necessary).

This command will ALWAYS cause a card to enter the IDLE state, no matter the current state of the card.

## Step 2. Send SEND_IF_COND (CMD8).

This is the "send interface condition" command.


# Loading Applications Demo

Just for interest, here is the output of BitThunder 0.6.0, loading the previous version from
an SD-card. The 8 second delay is completely artificial caused by a call to BT_ThreadSleep();

This demonstration is running on the Zynq ZED BOARD from Digilent.
